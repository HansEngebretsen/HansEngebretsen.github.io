          <p>I'm passionate about creating focused experiences through intuitive design &amp; smart development. I do both design &amp; development, but ultimately I just love making things. I often get excited about the little things in life like <a href="https://www.simple.com/">Simple</a>, <a href="http://tryghost.com">Ghost</a>, Apple, Costco, Amazon Prime, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">LMGTFY</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/d6X1UAwCys/">Travel</a>, and of course, my dog <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kXBBvfwC80/">Lucy</a>, and wife <a href="http://instagram.com/p/eDgqceQC-u/">Bailey</a>.</p>
          <p>This site is built without a cms, and hosted completely free. It uses HTML, Grunt, Sass, Jekyll, and <s>Amazon S3</s> Github Pages. The <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen" target="_blank">full source</a> is on Github. If you want to know more about my work, see if we can work together, or just say hello, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:engebretsenh@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
