I"ç<p>I‚Äôve been learning to make websites for around 14 years, here‚Äôs my storied history making things on the web.</p>

<hr />

<div class="history-content">
  <h4 id="section">2003</h4>
  <p>Made one of my first table-based HTML websites. No CSS, all tables and plenty of headaches, mostly caused by the slow speed of my eMachines Pentium 3 with 256 mb of RAM.<br />
<br />
Got my first bootleg copy of Photoshop 6.0</p>

  <h4 id="section-1">2004</h4>
  <p>Realized that making basic Geocities sites, Freewebs, and Google sites was much easier than struggling through table-based HTML websites, so I used things like Photoshop, Gimp, Geocities, Freewebs to get the job done. Big into site counters, guestbooks, quotes and favorite links.<br />
<br />
Made <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/1stperiodenglish/home">a site</a> for 1st period English class, still (partially) alive today.</p>

  <h4 id="section-2">2005</h4>
  <p>Got super pumped about my first 256mb flash drive I found &amp; sent this email to my computer science teacher.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Date: Sat, 3 Dec 2005 17:41:44 -0600 <br />
 I just bought a 256mb USB flash drive from best buy for about 20 dollars! sweet eh?</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><br />
Discovered the wonders of Open Source software, and compiled and installed my very own Linux distro. Still making <del>crappy</del> awesome Googlepages [sites] (https://sites.google.com/site/walive/home)<br />
<br />
First gmail account. Big year.</p>

  <h4 id="section-3">2006</h4>
  <p>Signed up for Facebook, and bought my first iMac (g5), officially making the transition from PC ‚Äî&gt; Mac. Never looked back.<br />
<br />
Gave a presentation in 7th period English class on open source programs, resulting in a popularity deficit I would never fully recover from.</p>

  <h4 id="section-4">2007</h4>
  <p>Updated my <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hanse00/home">site</a> to be hosted on Google sites upgrading from Freewebs.  Complete with a guest book, useful links, and a quote section, and more importantly, still alive today.<br />
<br />
Continued on as webmaster of several prestigious Freewebs, Geocities, Google sites and plain ol‚Äô HTML websites.</p>

  <h4 id="section-5">2008</h4>
  <p>Started making basic flash, and Macromedia Director sites and gory stick figure animations/ games. Reprimanded multiple times for pushing the boundaries of stick figure violence in the classroom.<br />
<br />
Most of the flash sites consisted of modifying a flash template that was purchased for around $70, then making modifications and uploading one giant .swf file to update the entire site, but they all contained sweet music, and rad page transitions.</p>

  <h4 id="section-6">2009</h4>
  <p>Working on contract, I used Dreamweaver and basic PHP includes to make basic publishing websites for authors seeking publication.<br />
<br />
Also did some work for the since outdated search engine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha_(search_engine)">Cha Cha</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="section-7">2010</h4>
  <p>Still making sites with basic PHP includes, I graduated to big-boy tools like <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a>, <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyber Duck</a>, and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>. Updated my personal site to have a very large image of myself on the homepage, still using tons of ID‚Äôs and writing CSS like a monster.<br />
<br />
Began customizing Wordpress templates, and dealing with all the things that come with (databases, servers etc.). Made my first responsive webpage.</p>

  <h4 id="section-8">2011</h4>
  <p>Began using Git and version control with things like local dev, still FTP-ing, but now doing basic version control. Still making mostly Wordpress, Drupal and basic PHP sites. <br />
<br />
Tried my first hand at e-commerce using Wordpress plugins and dabbling in <a href="https://magento.com/">Magento</a> and using <a href="https://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="section-9">2012</h4>
  <p>Architected my first fully autonomous ‚Äòstack‚Äô (if you could call it that).  Working for an agency that was looking to do online video to consumer sales, I created an automated system (that 1 person could maintain). The whole thing was built to allow users to buy and automatically receive videos. Included user accounts, 800 new video uploads/month, and at least that in transactions/month.<br />
<br />
The system was a combination of <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, <a href="http://www.fetchapp.com/">Fetchapp</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon s3</a>, a whole mess of custom scripts, and xml importing ‚Äì I got real friendly with spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
Discovered <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalkapp</a> for deployment.  Moved my personal site from it‚Äôs own hosting to a static site (generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>) and hosted on Amazon S3.  Went from $20/month to $1/month.</p>

  <h4 id="section-10">2013</h4>
  <p>Still doing custom Wordpress templates, and basic PHP websites - both at work and in freelance, as well as occasional HTML/CSS app/UX work. Moved my personal site from S3 to just <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Went from $1/m to $0/m.<br />
<br />
Discovered <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> and all the things that I still use today, that make front-end development so much more pleasurable than just slaying straight code.</p>

  <h4 id="section-11">2014</h4>
  <p>Started experimenting with other CMSs that were a bit more barebones, and allowed more flexibility particularly for small scale freelance work. Settled on using <a href="https://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a>. Still use it, and love it.<br />
<br />
Through work, started really digging into using proper MVC. Mostly used <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> which handled some more complicated routing, and enterprise ecommerce. Discovered the monstrosity of large-scale websites, and the mess of multiple systems/home-brewed solutions that a large company can encompass.</p>

  <h4 id="section-12">2015</h4>
  <p>Officially appealing to the static-site generator mentality. Using Jekyll for more than just free Github pages sites, I migrated Laravel projects/structure to a static site structure. For a lot of the smaller sites, Laravel wasn‚Äôt worth the pain/overhead. Relying almost completely on static site compilers, basic tempting, and occasional home-brewed APIs.<br />
<br />
Started writing big-boy Javascript, getting pretty modular, and parting (somewhat) from jQuery.</p>

  <h4 id="section-13">2016</h4>
  <p>Continued using Jekyll as a static site generator - simplifying my front end tooling to
Jekyll, Grunt, Sass, Stash (or Dropbox), Browserify, Imagemin and Autoprefixer.<br />
<br />
Built my first ‚Äòfrom-the-ground-up‚Äô Node app, a fun little thing that scraped ESPN‚Äôs brackets for March Madness - I did a <a href="https://haaans.com/node/">write up</a> about how.</p>
