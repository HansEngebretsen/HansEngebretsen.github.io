I";<p>After dabbling in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> for a while, and toying with the idea of using for more than just a mobile mockup or two, I finally bit the bullet and used Sketch for everything on a (mostly interface-design) project. Sketch isn‚Äôt a replacement for Photoshop so much as it as replacement for a collection of things Photoshop is used for which it isn‚Äôt meant to excel at. Brushes, complicated masks, curves (photo editing features in general) and effects aren‚Äôt thing Sketch tries to replicate/replace.</p>

<h4 id="--its-a-primitive-product"><span class="negative-bullet">-</span> It‚Äôs a primitive product</h4>
<p>PS is tested. Years of versions, millions of users, and bazillions of dollars. It‚Äôs easy to take that for granted after loosing an hour of work from a crash. Bohemian Coding has only been working on Sketch for 3 years; contrast that to a product that has been on the market for 25 years, and the difference is noticeable. In light of that, it‚Äôs fairly remarkable that they‚Äôre able to come up with something worthy comparing to PS (they even have a <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/community/">decent commmunity</a>. That said, it clearly doesn‚Äôt have the flavor that a well-seasoned product like Photoshop does, but that‚Äôs okay - mostly because it also doesn‚Äôt carry the price tag that PS does.</p>

<h4 id="--i-miss-the-keyboard-shortcuts"><span class="negative-bullet">-</span> I miss the keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>That‚Äôs it ‚Äì I just miss the keyboard shortcuts PS has that Sketch has replaced with a less-cryptic, (slower but more usable) interface.</p>

<h4 id="-it-still-hasnt-crashed-on-me"><span class="positive-bullet">+</span> It still hasn‚Äôt crashed on me</h4>
<p>PS has a bad habit of crashing. It has effectively reinvoked my former muscle memory for command S. Combined with it‚Äôs pathetic recovery effort, it can be awfully frustrating. Despite having around twice as many elements in a given document, Sketch stuttered, but never lost my work.</p>

<h4 id="-organization-clean-and-easy"><span class="positive-bullet">+</span> Organization, Clean and Easy</h4>
<p>To me the most valuable use for Sketch is organization. Where I would have needed 10 PS files, 1 Indesign document, and countless inconsistencies, I was able to easily use single Sketch file. Leveraging cascading properties, and the seamless ways groups work allowed me to design on the fly. What I lost in functionality and learning curve, Sketch made up in time-saving file/style management.

<h4 id="--exporting-as-it-should-be"><span class="neutral-bullet">+-</span> Exporting, As it should be</h4>
<p>This is a heavily-touted feature in Sketch, that was different, but it really isn‚Äôt a make or break for me. It‚Äôs nice, convenient, and saved a few minutes here and there, but it isn‚Äôt something that I‚Äôve been particularly frustrated at with PS.

<h4 id="will-it-blend">Will it Blend?</h4>
<p>That‚Äôs the big question - I‚Äôll certainly use it on the next project, until it can‚Äôt do what I need and then I‚Äôll switch to PS. I may learn a few more keyboard shortcuts, and a few more tricks. In the end it saved me time vs costing me it - but that‚Äôll be on a case-by-case basis. I do a good amount of concepting in program (things like ‚Äúhow does this look here‚Äù, and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try this‚Äù), so it certainly helps with an iterative workflow, that seeks to get digital as soon as possible.</p>
