My March and April was filled with 28 different airplanes, 16 states, 3 countries, over 30 trout, over 3k miles driving, and a new job. It’s been a pretty exciting stage of life, I couldn’t be more grateful, or feel luckier. I don’t think of myself as “that guy” & spend more time asking “what, how do people do that stuff?”, than doing stuff like that. But also probably sounds like something “that guy” would say though. At any rate, here’s the story. 

#### From one big G to the next
Around 6 months ago, I made a short list of places that I’d always wanted to live and companies that I’d always wanted to work for. Tops was Google, but it also included places you might expect like Netflix, Facebook, a startup, etc. Spent a few weekends dusting off my resume, updating my portfolio, etc. After spending some time brushing up my resume/portfolio,  I talked with a few connections in places we thought it’d be great to live and filled out some applications (some via connections, but mostly ‘cold apps’). This was a pretty casual process - I had a great job at Garmin, and loved what I was already doing. 

I was pretty flattered to get callbacks from several places over the course of the next few months - agencies, a few big companies (including Google), and startups - my afternoons became complicated juggling recruiter phone calls, etc.

I spent a lot of time preparing and interviewing, and in the process found some potential fits, and some ‘no-fits’. I had to make some hard decisions turning down opportunities, and got turned down on others - something I attribute to God’s divine providence, and timing. 

The entire Google process took over 5 months, and was one of the most extensive and (strangely enough) rewarding interview experiences I’ve ever been a part of. I applied to Google online, without any internal connections, and ended up getting the job. There’s been tons of luck in that, mixed in with a whole bunch of hard work.  

#### A busy month 
<span style="margin-bottom:2em; line-height:0;font-style:italic;display:block;">(from ski slopes to Thai street food to Trout waters of Yellowstone)</span>

Although we'd just gotten back from a nordic adventure a few months prior, I’m a strong proponent of adventuring when you can. I like what Audrey Sutherland was quoted saying in *Let My People Go Surfing*, “Don’t spend money on gear, spend it on airplane tickets”.

There’s only been a handful of times where I’ve been able to take a month or two off and being in between jobs / moving cities was the perfect excuse. Below is some of the adventuring Bailey and I did.

When I received the job offer from Google, we'd never even been to Seattle. The weekend after I accepted the job, we flew out to Seattle to see what we had signed up for.

The following weekend, we had planned a weekend trip out to Denver to see some Senators hockey, and shred some gnar with my sisters. </p>

In one of my finest flight deals ($450 rt), my sister joined Bailey and I on a trip around Thailand, now one of my favorite places. Highlights included elephant TLC in Chiang Mai, private Island life in Phuket, and China too. </p>

<div class="image-wrap-l "><img src="/img-content/googs/vegas.jpg" alt="Las Vegas"></div><p class="paragraph-left">In our plans, we had a gap week just in case we weren’t able to find a home in Seattle the first trip out, so naturally, we went to Vegas. Vegas can actually be quite cheap if you don’t gamble (tickets were $79 rt, and our hotel/resort was under $65/n) - Grand Canyon too. </p>

The whole ‘moving across the US’ thing turned out to make a pretty spectacular road trip vacation. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kansas+City,+MO/Omaha,+NE/Mount+Rushmore+National+Memorial,+South+Dakota+244,+Keystone,+SD/Deadwood,+SD/Jackson+Hole,+WY/Yellowstone+National+Park,+Wyoming/Bozeman,+MT/Missoula,+MT/Spokane,+WA/Seattle,+WA/@46.8550418,-119.2713165,4.55z/data=!4m62!4m61!1m5!1m1!1s0x87c0f75eafe99997:0x558525e66aaa51a2!2m2!1d-94.5785667!2d39.0997265!1m5!1m1!1s0x87938dc8b50cfced:0x46424d4fae37b604!2m2!1d-95.9979883!2d41.2523634!1m5!1m1!1s0x877d35d8b53ed6df:0xdaf53dbe055cc641!2m2!1d-103.4590667!2d43.8791025!1m5!1m1!1s0x5332a41e88e71e55:0x3e9d03de70805b0f!2m2!1d-103.7296415!2d44.376651!1m5!1m1!1s0x53531a58fccf7f4b:0x3d1c01cbb13a835c!2m2!1d-110.7624282!2d43.4799291!1m5!1m1!1s0x5351e55555555555:0xaca8f930348fe1bb!2m2!1d-110.588455!2d44.427963!1m5!1m1!1s0x5345444c4fba8813:0x63f5d064f73b60aa!2m2!1d-111.0429339!2d45.6769979!1m5!1m1!1s0x535dcc2a50f367cb:0xe9e31277ca94802e!2m2!1d-113.996586!2d46.8787176!1m5!1m1!1s0x549e185c30bbe7e5:0xddfcc9d60b84d9b1!2m2!1d-117.4260466!2d47.6587802!1m5!1m1!1s0x5490102c93e83355:0x102565466944d59a!2m2!1d-122.3320708!2d47.6062095!3e0">Here's the route we took</a> - I would *highly* recommend this trip, the Northwestern US has some truly spectacular stuff. Having a steak for 4 consecutive nights in 4 different states may have been the highlight; and of course - fly fishing in Bozeman.

#### That's all
  <p class="paragraph-left"  markdown="1">
    I had my first week of orientation at Google in Mountain View last month - somewhere I never thought I’d be. My wife and I got rid of ~half of all our things (including a car), lived out of a suitcase for 2 months, and along with Lucy moved into our 657 Sq ft apartment in Seattle. I'm incredibly fortunate - not only for the opportunities, but also Bailey who sported all of it, quit her job, and moved to a place she'd never been. 

    Don’t worry, my IG will calm down, and I’ll probably return to a lackluster routined life of cynicism in no time, but for now, I feel pretty lucky, grateful and excited.
