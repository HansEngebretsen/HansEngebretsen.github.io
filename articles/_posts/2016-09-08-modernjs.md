I started a project a few weeks ago, and decided it was high time to give ES6 / ES2015 a whirl. This is just the practical set of stuff I used getting started, and how I thought about the differences – mostly just syntax highlighting with a little bit of ‘how to organize your JS’. Official terms, nomenclature, and ‘the right way’ aren’t always my forte, but getting the job done is, and this is no different. If you’ve used ES6 before, you probably already know most of this, and might even be able to correct me on some of it. 

#### Comparison
If you’re just looking for an example, or a side-by-side comparison of the same exact functionality in ES6, I re-wrote a recent pen in ES6 just for a side-by-side comparison.

# The highlights
The easiest way to get started right off the bat with ES 6 is to use [CodePen](https://blog.codepen.io/2015/05/19/babel-now-on-codepen-write-es6-javascript-and-react-jsx/), and select the “babel” as a javascript preprocessor.



#### Variables, let, const, var and globals
There’s been some debate over some of this (it’s a bit more complex than a 1-1 change), but here’s what I’ve gathered:
`var` declares a function-scoped variable, and
`let` declares a locally, block-scoped variable
`const` declares a read-only variable, meaning you can’t do this `const = “foo”; const = “bar”` .

##### Basically
`let myVariable = "dustin" ` is the new ` var myVariable = "dustin" `
`const myVariable = “dustin”` is a new never-changing variable

##### When to Use
Just use `let` everywhere you would have used `var`.

#### Strings, variables and template literals
The backtick is the new cool kid in town when it comes to strings.  When you want to combine variables, or even logic with a string, you no longer have to use quote and `+`, you can simply wrap the string in a `` ` `` (backtick) and then wrap any variables or logical with `${}`. This makes concatenation a breeze. You can also do multiline strings. 

##### Basically
`“my name is” + user.name + user.lastname + “ .”` can be simplified to `` `my name is ${user.name user.lastname} .` `` 

##### When to Use 
Anytime you need to combine variables with strings, use backticks `` ` `` and `${}`.


#### This, Scoping and Arrow Functions
For me, arrow functions were kinda ES6’s poster-boy. Mostly because they look so…functiony. There’s a few different ways you can write them (more shorthand options), but it’s all basically a form of `let something = (parameters)
 => { //do something }`. The scoping of ‘this’ is a bit different when using an arrow function.  Basically using an arrow function will pass this on through so that `this = this`. The official term for how javascript handles scope is lexical scoping. Meaning when you declare something in javascript, it’s a block-level local variable. 

The way you’re used to a new “this scope” being created every time you use the word “function”, still works the same, but doesn’t happen when you use an arrow function. 

##### Basically 
``` javascript
// old stuff
$('a').click(function(){ console.log(this) }) // returns what you’d expect, 'a'

// ES6
$('a').click((e)=>{ console.log(this)} // returns the parent’s value for 'this'

// old stuff equivalent
var t = this; $('a').click(function(){console.log(t); } // essentially the same but without the messiness.
```

##### When to Use 
Anytime you’re writing a function that you don’t want to have a new this scope, use an arrow function.

#### Modular stuff: imports, classes, extends, constructors, etc.
Remember when Sass first hit the masses, and people started using @import again to organize, and modularize their css/sass because it didn’t require an additional request? well, you can basically do the same thing using imports and classes.

We’re gonna get a little hairy on some of the more opinionated js stuff, but here goes: Structurally, I’ve got one main.js that handles the loading/instantiation of everything, the separate independent modules. 


+ main.js 
+ modules
  + _carousel.js
  + _myFunction.js
+ lib 
  + jQuery.min.js
  + waypoints.min.js
  + gsap.min.js


##### Basically
I’d put these two lines in my main.js ( what I use to instantiates/call everything else)

``` javascript  
import myFunction from './modules/myFunction'

// On document load, or ready or whenever I want to run it
let myFunction = new myFunction();
```

Then in each module (_myFunction.js),  I’ve got an init function that runs when it’s called so, and you wrap everything in a class export, using the constructor method (a special method) to start things off – like so: 
``` javascript
 export default class {
  constructor(){
    this.init(); // Run the init whenever invoked
  }
  init() {
    // do something
  }
}
```


##### When to Use 
Write your JS in a modular way (there’s several options, above is just one example). You’ll love it for the clarity and readability it brings your JS.

#### Other stuff
There’s also a couple of things that help for dealing with numbers (I haven’t yet come across the need for them)  like spread operators and rest parameters. Check out the links below for more on those.
