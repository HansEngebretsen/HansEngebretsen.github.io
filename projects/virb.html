          <p>Color has never been "my jam" as a designer, and I'm not nearly as good at utilizing it as <a href="http://www.invisibleelement.com/" about="_blank">other designers</a> (in fact, I might consider it one of my weaker points). But I was challenged to use a pallete as extreme, youthful, vibrant and exciting as the people the VIRB serves, and it turned out to be a blast</p>
