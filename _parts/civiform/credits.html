        <p>Add the word 'simple' to something and it sounds like it should be easy – but often, I find, the simpler the experience, the more complex the details get. Things like seamless transitions, single-page experience, and url updating were crucial to the overall UX on this site – which lead to quite a few late nights (by way of which, I got real familiar with AJAX, HTML5 history and GSAP), some frustrating days, and plenty of opportunity to learn new stuff.  In the midst of tackling these types of complexities, we were transitioning off of our cumbersome database model, and to a more simplified static-site model. This helped greatly reduce overhead/complexity in our front-end workflows and delivery, as well as to flex the muscles of my favorite static site generator, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" alt="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>
