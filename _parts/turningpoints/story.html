    <h4 class="pre-title">Intro</h4>
    <h1>Setting the Stage</h1>
    <p>We needed something that would introduce users to the idea of the campaign, and equally as important, introduce the Forerunner 735xt. Using Greensock, I was able to animate HTML 5 elements to create an intro that also served as a loaded for other elements. </p>

    <h4 class="pre-title">Story</h4>
    <h1>A Focus on the Story</h1>
    <p>Each athlete had a story about a moment in their career they considered a Turning Point, outlined in a biographical-style video. Highlighting quotes on the athletes page helped draw a focus to the athlete's unique stories of struggle and redemption, their turning points.</p>

    <h4 class="pre-title">Experience</h4>
    <h1>A Single Experience</h1>
    <p>The entire app was built with the idea of being a single page experience. Despite not using a framework, I was able to utilize tools like AJAX, the HTML 5 history API, and Greensock's <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">GSAP</a> animation library to create a seamless experience that transitioned from one page to the next.</p>
