        <p>The client for JournalBot was a backend developer, and was building out the functionality of the app, so there was no need a CMS, or complicated deliverables, and the full source (Sass, and HTML partials) were able to be leveraged for integration/maintenance. I used git for version control and to collaborate throughout the project with the client. To keep things private, I hosted the remote on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960799/using-git-and-dropbox-together-effectively" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. For the build process, and concatenating the html/js partials, I used <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen/grunt-boilerplate" target="_blank">my typical workflow</a> of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>/<a href="http://sasslang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a> etc.</p>
