    <h1>A Compelling Intro</h1>
    <p>This was the heart of the app, where users spent most of their time, and where we spent ours. The app's smart capabilities and its learning functionality was dependent on users categorizing articles based on their preferences.  It was crucial to make filling out a form easy, appealing, and natural. We ended up compressing a form that used autocomplete and validation into a plus button at the bottom of each thumbnail, and it worked swimmingly.</p>
