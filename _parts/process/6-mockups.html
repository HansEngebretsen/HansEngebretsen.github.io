  <h1>try it out</h1>
  <p>I’ll use sketch or illustrator to quickly mock something up. Usually duplicating artboards like crazy to try out alterations of the same ideas, get a rough idea of how something might lay
out on mobile. I’ll try something out starting with squares and circles and eventually adding color.</p>
