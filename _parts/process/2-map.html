  <h1>map it out</h1>
  <p>Visually mapping helps me make sense of convoluted things and simplify complexity. Whether it's a user flow, a set of pages, or even the structure of Javascript used in a project, I'll make a site map / graph / mindmap to help myself and others understand the scope and stay focused on the user's context. </p>
