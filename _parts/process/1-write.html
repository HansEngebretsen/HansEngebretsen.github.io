  <h1>just write it down</h1>
  <p>Most of the time, things start with just writing words down, maybe drawing a box or two. I write stuff everywhere - in notebooks, on spam mail, sticky notes, and iOS notes. I hardly ever loook back and reference this stuff, but for me, writing it down helps the good stuff stick. </p>
