  <h1>get it in the browser ASAP</h1>
  <p>Something might seem real nice in Sketch, or Photoshop, but feel completely different in the browser. Once Iâ€™ve got a vision, or a few visions of what might work, I like to get it in the browser as soon as possible. This can happen at any stage, often times, it might just be a small or partial component. </p>
