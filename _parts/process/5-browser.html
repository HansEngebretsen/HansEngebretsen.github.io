  <h1>get it in the browser ASAP</h1>
  <p>What seems nice in Sketch or Photoshop can feel completely different in a browser. Once I’ve got some type of vision, I like to get it in the browser right away. If we're testing something out, I'll often use a tool like Axure. Otherwise, I'm faster at simply coding things using straight HTML/CSS/Javascript/CodePen to get a more accurate feel, test feasibility, try interactions, and sometimes even use as a mockup.</p>
