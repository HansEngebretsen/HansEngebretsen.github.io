      <h4>The Systems</h4>
      <p>This wasn't my first project diving-deep into enterprise ecommerce, but it was certainly one of the most complex. From a technical standpoint, reformatting the information architecture and redesiging the site required interacting with, and working through several different CMSs and systems that each had their own teams, processes, and tooling. </p>

      <h4>The People</h4>
      <p>The technical complexities were only a portion of the equation â€“ from navigating the mirky political waters of a Fortune 500 tech company, to ADA compliance, it was truly a group effort. Although we handled the design, UX, and prototyping, we looked to several of the many wonderful IT &amp; business teams at Garmin for front-end integration, translation, back-end support, and implementation details.
