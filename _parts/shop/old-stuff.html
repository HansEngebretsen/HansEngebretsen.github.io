    <h1>The old stuff</h1>
    <p class="container">Garmin.com has over 30 million visits a month, so we had access to an abundance of user stats, user research, and business goals to consider at the outset. We spent hundreds of hours reviewing analytics, collaborating, in kick-off meetings, pitching things, on phone calls, in stand-ups, user testing, prototyping, outlining, and wire-framing in a process that took over a year to complete. </p>
