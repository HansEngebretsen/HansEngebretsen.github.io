    <h1>Refining things</h1>
    <p class="container">Initially (as it often is), our task was to consider a single isolated portion of the garmin.com shopping experience, a single page. When we did an exploration on the user experience of the page (and consequentially the buying experience), we identified three main areas of need for the redesign. We worked hard to convince stakeholder's of the need to view things as an experience that translated across the site â€“ no matter the device.</p>
    <p class="container">We went through a countless amount of meetings, documentation, stand-ups, user tests, content-outlines, and wireframes working to agree on the content for each page/view, and structural requirements. We spent hundreds of hours reviewing analytics, collabroating, and outlining everything.</p>
