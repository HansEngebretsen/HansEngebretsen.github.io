        <h4>User Experience</h4>
        <p>When we did an exploration and analysis on the UX of garmin.com and the buying experience, we identified 3 main areas of focus for the redesign. Because this was the first responsive design of garmin.com, we had to work hard to guide stakeholders through viewing things as an experience translating across the site â€“ no matter the device.</p>

        <h4>Considering the Basics</h4>
        <p>This wasn't simply an aesthetic or interface overhaul. Using content-outlines, analytics, user-data, user tests, and wireframes, we were able to prioritize content and appropriately re-factor it throughout the site.</p>
