    <h1>On Every Device</h1>
    <p>Before being redesigned, Garmin.com had this truly unfortunate system that browser sniffed, fully loaded the desktop version of a page, then loaded a separate mobile-specific page on top of every single page.</p>
    <p>Pretty much anything would have been an improvement in terms of performance, but we also pushed hard to have a cohesive experience â€“ meaning desktop, mobile, tablet, phablet, all the things felt like a part of the same site. Nothing was removed on mobile, just reorganized.</p>
