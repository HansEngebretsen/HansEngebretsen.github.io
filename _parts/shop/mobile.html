    <h1>On Every Device</h1>
    <p>This was the first fully-responsive design on garmin.com. Before, a separate mobile experience was generated using a system that browser sniffed, fully loaded the desktop version of a page, then loaded a separate mobile-specific page on top of every single page.</p>
    <p>We were able to make giant improvements in terms of performance as well as experience. We pushed hard to maintain a cohesive experience – meaning desktop, mobile, tablet, and phablet felt like a part of the same site. Nothing was removed on mobile, just reorganized.</p>
