    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Garmin.com is a giant ecommerce site that gets over 300 million hits a year, and generates millions of dollars of revenue a year. Redesigning the site was as difficult, politically sensative, involved, and thrilling as you might expect.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-6">
    <h4>Role</h4>
    <p>Operating as a team of three, Chris Partise, Katie Heinie and I led the design while working alongside UX teams, business marketing clients, and IT implementation teams for over a year. As you can imagine the redesign and restructure of such a large site involves the work of several teams.</p>
