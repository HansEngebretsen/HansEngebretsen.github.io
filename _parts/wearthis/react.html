    <h1>My first React App</h1>
    <p>At the time, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> was definately the cool kid on the block. After pitching the concept, I decided it was worth a few extra weekends to take the plunge into React, which is where the fun began. It was a strong shift in mentality, something I go into wrote about <a href="#">here</a>, and in the end, a pretty rewarding experience. </p>
