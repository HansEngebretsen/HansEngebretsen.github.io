    <p>Consistent lighting was crucial to the art direction of this project. I worked with <a href="http://www.ksimaging.net/">Kent Snipes</a> to shot over 320 different images in a single day on stark white backgrounds. We outsourced portions of the COB work, and I ended up adding color and doing some of the post work of comping shadows with 3d renders to finalize imagery. </p>
