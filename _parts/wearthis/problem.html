      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Garmin gets gobs of feedback on social media, from personal connections, and through support from folks interested in a device, but overwhelmed by the options, asking "which Garmin should I get?". It was something that we were aproached with multiple times from execs, support and social teams alike.  </p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
      <h4>The Users</h4>
      <p>Our users were folks that were less interested in advanced metrics / spec-charts, and more interested in basic fitness tracking, but overwhelmed by the 15 devices Garmin was marketing to them at the time. We targeted users beginning their research and in an intial, exploratory mood (what we called "the browser").</p>
