    <h1>Which tracker is for me?</h1>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Garmin gets gobs of feedback on social media and through support from folks interested in a device but overwhelmed by the options.  We were aproached with tacking the "Which Garmin should I get?" question multiple times from execs, support and social teams alike. </p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
      <h4>A Clear User</h4>
      <p>Our users were folks that were less interested in advanced metrics / spec-charts, and more interested in basic fitness tracking but potentially overwhelmed by the 15 activity trackers Garmin had at the time. We targeted users beginning their research and in an initial, exploratory mood (what we called "the browser").</p>
