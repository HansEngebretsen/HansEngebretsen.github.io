    <h1>The Concept</h1>
      <p>Working together with our SEO Analyst &amp; digital insights team, we explored the questions these users were asking online. Focusing on those in a browsing stage of purchase, and we prepared a summary that found terms like "fitness tracker" to be over 600% more common than "wearables", with people frequently prepending their search with "best", or "top". This clarified our focus throughout the project, and served to later inform things like copy and overall IA.</p>
