        <p>Developing and designing the experience for a fully functioning application, can be quite challenging, particularly when it comes to communication. Pages, views, states, hovers, pop-ups, overlays can all mush together and difficult to represent. We approached this by mapping out all of the pages and views into visual user flows, and using that as our frame of reference for the rest of the project.</p>
