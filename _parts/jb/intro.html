      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>JournalBot was a smart RSS feed / article aggregation app that learned and adapted to your RSS preferences. While the back end services and algorithms were being created, Chris &amp; I worked to provide a vision for the customer experience, visual brand, and front-end code.</p>
<!--       <p>We were approached by a developer who had created the back end services and algorithms used in JournalBot, and needed a vision for the customer experience, visual brand, and front-end code.</p>

      <h4>Role</h4>
      <p>I had a blast collaborating with one of the best web designers I know, <a href="http://chrispartise.com/">Chris Partise</a> on this project. We worked together on UX, IA, and site structure. Being a single page app, it provided a great opportunity to focus on interaction design.</p>
