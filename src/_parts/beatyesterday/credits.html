            <h4>Nerdy Stuff</h4>
            <p>The interactive experience was built on the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> php framework, and an an API built (by Dustin Hayes) on top of Garmin Connect.
            I built the style guide using a custom jekyll architecture simular to the one found <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen/jekyll-boilerplate" target="_blank">here</a> to be able to use patials, but still generate static files.
            The email was built using a custom php script, and gif generator, check out <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen/dynamic-email">the source</a>.</p>
    <!--         <p>Over the course of 6 months, working with teams across engineering and IT, we were able to create the first ecommerce experience built outside of Garmin's buy.garmin.com architecture.</p>

            <h4>The People</h4>
            <p>From a creative standpoint, I collaborated throughout the project with Garmin creative directors <a href="http://www.ryan-g.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Glendening</a> and <a href="http://mattbowneexperiment.com/" target="_blank">Matt Bowne</a>.  We had great support from the Garmin Connect developer team, as well as Dustin Hayes who was the lead developer on <a href="http://letsbeatyesterday.com">letsbeatyesterday.com</a>, and helped with the email as well.</p>
