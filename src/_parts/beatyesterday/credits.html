        <p>The client on this project was a backend developer, and was building out the functionality of the app. Because of this, there was no need for any type of CMS, or complicated deliverables, and the full source (Sass, and HTML partials) were able to be levereaged for maitenence and integration. I used git for version control and to collaborate throughout the project with the client. To keep things private, I hosted the remote on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960799/using-git-and-dropbox-together-effectively" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. For the build process, and concating the html/js partials, I used <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen/grunt-boilerplate" target="_blank">my typical workflow</a> of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>/<a href="http://sasslang.com" target="_blank">Sass</a> etc.</p>
