    <h1>Mobile is <span alt="king">ðŸ‘‘</span></h1>
    <p>Knowing that most of the site's user base would be accessing the app on their phone, it was was important that things worked just as well (if not better) on mobile. The majority of the site was developed mobile first, which provided a interesting challenge working from desktop mockups. Fortunately, the flexible design provided ample room and structure to work well responsively.</p>
