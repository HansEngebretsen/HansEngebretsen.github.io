    <h1>Email too!</h1>
    <p>You know what sucks? Designing &amp; developing emails. Following the live-data-big-numbers theme, I was able to leverage the same API to build a dynamic, self-updating email based on the time of day, and the world's current numbers.</p>
    <p>Turns out, dynamic stuff in email is <s>the worst</s> sorta hard. I wrote about all of the nerdy details <a href="http://codepen.io/hans/post/dynamic-emails" target="_blank">here</a>, and even posted the source code on <a href="https://github.com/HansEngebretsen/dynamic-email" target="_blank">github</a>. The email won a KC Interactive Gold Addy.</p>
