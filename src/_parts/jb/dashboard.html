The app's smart capabilities and it's learning functionality was dependent on users categorizing articles based on their preferences, so one of the most challenging parts was getting users to fill out a form for each article, make it appealing, easy and natural. We ended up compressing a whole form that used autocomplete and validation into a plus button at the bottom of each thumbnail, and it worked swimmingly.</p>
