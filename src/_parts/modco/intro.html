      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>When it comes to big oil and gas I'm not exactly an engineer. Which is why I relate Modco to a gas cap, but for the giant oil and water pipes instead of my '02 Taurus. More officially; Modco makes the best in class easy access ( < 1 min) threaded pipeline closures.</p>

      <p>Working together with my good friend <a href="http://invisibleelement.com">Jason Yang</a> (who served as project manager), I served as main consultant as well as designer and developer on the entire site.</p>
