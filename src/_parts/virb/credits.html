        <h4>Nerdy Stuff</h4>
        <p>The core of the project was built on the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> php framework, and a homebrewed product API. We used Sass to organize our css, vanilla javascript, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/server">stash</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a> to host and deploy our git repos and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to run our slew of automated tasks.</p>
<!--         <p>Over the course of 6 months, working with teams across engineering and IT, we were able to create the first ecommerce experience built outside of Garmin's buy.garmin.com architecture.</p>
