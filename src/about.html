          <p>I'm passionate about serving up focused experiences through intuitive design & aesthetic. I get pumped about the little things in life, like <a href="https://www.simple.com/">Simple</a>, <a href="http://tryghost.com">Ghost</a>, Apple, Costco, Amazon Prime, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">LMGTFY</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/d6X1UAwCys/">Travel</a>, and of course my dog <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kXBBvfwC80/">Lucy</a> and wife <a href="http://instagram.com/p/eDgqceQC-u/">Bailey</a>.</p>

          <p>This site is built sans-CMS with straight CSS & HTML (uses Grunt, Sass, and Amazon S3 to make things easier). If you want to know more about my work, just <a href="mailto:engebretsenh@gmail.com">email me</a> â€“ I'm a <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox</a> user, so I won't miss it. I'd be happy to pause for a second from honing my (impressive) stockpile of gifs to connect.</p>
