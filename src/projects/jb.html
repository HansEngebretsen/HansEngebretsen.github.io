          <p>It's <strike>hard</strike> nearly impossible to that achieve a sense of uniqueness (or at the very least don't seem part of an effortless boostrap library). I wanted buttons reminiscant of the strong materials used by Modco, that serve to further promote a look and feel of stability. Looking to serve as a foundation for a larger look and feel that seeks to combine a feeling of stability and strength with a simple, modern, relevant, and flat interface.   </p>
