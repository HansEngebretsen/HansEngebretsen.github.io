          <p>Color has never been "my jam" as a designer, and I'm not nearly as good at utilizing it as <a href="http://www.invisibleelement.com/" about="_blank">other designers</a> (in fact, I consider it one of my weaker points). But I was challenged to use a pallete as extreme, youthful, vibrant and exciting as the people the VIRB serves, and it turned out to be a blast</p>

            <p>Things get sloppy. Deadlines. Committees of design review. Basterdized code. Revisions upon revisions. After launch, and in an effort to acheive product brand cohesion, the decision was made to transform the aesthetic which is the site you'll see today (below).</p>
